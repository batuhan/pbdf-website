More in particular, the foundation focuses on the development, roll
out, and actual usage of its own system [IRMA](/irma-en), an
abbreviation of *I Reveal My Attributes*. With IRMA people can prove
in a privacy-friendly and secure manner various personal properties
(attributes) about themselves (such as: I'm older than 18), without
revealing any other non-relevant information.

In addition, IRMA allows its users to create attribute-based digital
signature, see [IRMA](/irma-explanation) for more information.

### Plans and activities for 2017

After its establishment as a legal entity in october 2016, the 
foundation's activities are taking shape. These activitities are
focused especially on the following points.

* Creating a financial basis for the activities of the
  foundation. This involves, in particular, the structural support
  that the energy company [Alliander](https://www.alliander.com/en)
  provides in 2017. In addition subsidy and project options will be
  investigated and possibly initiated.

* Consolidating the organisational structure of the foundation,
  especially by extending the board from 3 to 5 persons (realised in
  july 2017) and by applying for the *ANBI* status in the Netherlands,
  giving the foundation official recognition of working for the
  "general benefit", which comes with several tax benefits --- both
  for the foundation itself and for its supporters (e.g. financial
  support becomes tax deductable).

* Establishing and maintaining the website of the foundation. A Dutch
  version appeared early 2017, and mid 2017, an english version too.

* Getting the infrastructure up and running for attribute-based
  authentication and rolling out the IRMA
  system. [Issuance](/issuance) of different attributes is now
  possible, mainly from Dutch sources, including for instance
  registration attributes for medical professionals. The foundation
  will not offer verification services, but it does cooperate with
  other parties who intend to verify IRMA attributes
  (esp. [SURFnet](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/subsidiaries/surfnet)).

* Development of an IRMA app for iOS, to complement the existing app
  for Android.

* Organising a stable software development capacity for extending and
  maintaining the IRMA ecosystem.

* Seeking and starting collaborations with different players in the
  identity management area in the Netherlands, and possibly also
  beyond.

* Increasing the familiarity of the name and brand of the Privacy by
  Design foundation in general, and of attribute-based authentication
  with IRMA in particular.

### Reporting

The foundation has been established at the end of 2016. Het first year
report, including an overview of activities and a financial report,
