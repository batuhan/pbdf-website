This page collects, in reverse chronological order, scientific
publications about the IRMA ecosystem, mostly written by researchers
from the [Digital Security Group](http://www.ru.nl/ds/) of Radboud
University, Nijmegen. The cryptographic techniques underlying IRMA
have been developed by IBM Research in ZÃ¼rich, under the name
[Idemix](https://idemix.wordpress.com/), short for *Identity Mixer*,
see this [brief
summary](https://www.irmacard.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Idemix_overview.pdf)
