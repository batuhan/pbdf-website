Official diploma data in The Netherlands are available online via
[DUO](https://duo.nl/particulier/diplomas/mijn-diplomas.jsp). When you
login there via DigiD, you can download pdf documents describing your
diplomas, including school and study. This is available online from a
certain year onwards (e.g. 1995), depending on school and study.

These pdf documents are digitally signed by DUO in a professional
manner. This guarantees that they are genuine (authentic and
non-modified).

In order to load your diploma data as IRMA attributes, you first have
to collect these pdf documents from DUO. After logging on at
[DUO](https://duo.nl/particulier/diplomas/mijn-diplomas.jsp) you can
select and download your diplomas, typically with name:
Uittreksel_diplomaregister.pdf

On the [diploma issuance](/issuance/diploma) page of the Privacy by
Design foundation you can upload such a diploma document. The
foundation checks the digital signature of DUO.

In order to get this diploma into your IRMA app, two more steps are
needed.

  * You need to prove that you are the person mentioned in the diploma
    document. You prove this by disclosing via IRMA your name, date of
    birth and gender. This requires that these data are already in
    your IRMA app (via BRP or iDIN).

  * Next, you can add the diploma data as attributes in the IRMA app
    on your mobile phone. This step requires a few seconds, after
    pushing the relevant (third) button, because the diploma data need
    to be extracted from the pdf document.

The Privacy by Design foundation removes the pdf file that you
uploaded and all diploma data from its systems after issuance. The
foundation does not keep a record of such issuances.

The whole procedure is complicated and fragile. Hopefully, the
procedure will become simpler and more robust in the future when DUO
decides to issue diploma data as IRMA attributed directly -- without
an intermediate role of the Privacy by Design foundation.
