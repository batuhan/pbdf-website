When you registered your IRMA app, you provided an email address which
is associated with your [MyIRMA](/myirma) account. This email address
has been issued as (first) attribute in your IRMA app.

You may wish to add additional email addresses as attributes in
your app.

As a first step of this issuance process, you provide your email
address. A verification email message is then sent to this address,
containing a link. When you follow that link, the email address will
be issued to you.

The validity period of this email address attribute is *one year*.

Immediately after issuance, the foundation removes this email
attribute from its own systems. The foundation does not keep a log of
issuance.
