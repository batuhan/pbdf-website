 1. I'm an **individual** who may want to use IRMA for the purpose of
    logging in online.

    You can try out the IRMA app by
    [installing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu)
    it (on an Android phone) and registering yourself via the app as
    IRMA user at the Privacy by Design foundation, with your email
    address (and nothing else). Subsequently, you [load](/issuance)
    additional attributes into your app, in order to assemble a kind
    of digital passport on your phone. Also, you can monitor the usage
    of your app via the [my IRMA](/myirma) environment. You can
    unsubscribe at any time and delete all your attributes. You can do
    all this free of charge.

    In case you prefer to read more about IRMA first, please consult
    [this page](/irma-explanation).

 2. I'm from a **webshop** or another **organisation** that may want
    to use IRMA in order to let customers/members log in
    (authenticate).

    The first relevant question for you is: which attributes do I need
    to verify about my customers when they log in? Possibly an email
    address or a mobile phone number suffices, but maybe you need
    (physical) address information. More [information](/irma-verifier)
    about this is available on a separate page.

 3. I'm simply **curious** and like to learn more about IRMA.

    With IRMA users fully control the release of their own attributes
    when they log in&#58; users only reveal those aspects of
    themselves that they are willing to show, see the following
    instruction video (from Radboud University, 2016)&#58;

    On the web you often have to prove who you are. This is called
    *authentication*. It involves, for instance, revealing your name,
    date of birth, or address, whereas all that is needed is proving
    that you are over 16. With IRMA you can selectively disclose only
    relevant properties (attributes) of yourself. There is an IRMA app
    that lets you store these attributes on your own mobile phone ---
    and nowhere else. This provides a flexible passport, from which
    you may or may not disclose certain parts, depending on the (login)
    situation.

    On a separate page [much more information](/irma-explanation) is
    available about personal attributes and about IRMA.
