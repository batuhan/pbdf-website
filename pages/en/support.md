The Privacy by Design foundation wishes to offer as many of its
services as possible for free. However, the activities of the
foundation do cost money, for instance, in order to keep the IRMA
infrastructure up and running and to develop and maintain new services
and software (among which, in particular, the [IRMA
app](https://privacybydesign.foundation/download/)).

The Privacy by Design foundation is a non-for-profit organisation.
But it does need funding for its activities. This is where you can
help, certainly if you appreciate the foundation's activities.

The foundation awards the special status *Friend of the Foundation* or
*Hero of the Foundation* to companies and other organisations, or
private citizens, that support the foundation with at least
ten thousand Euro (friends) or hundred thousand Euro (heros).

When you are interested in becoming a friend or hero of the
foundation, please contact the chairman of the foundation (voorzitter
'at' privacybydesign.foundation). Possible reasons for supporting the
foundation are:

* You value the development of a non-commercial open source identity
  platform that can be used by anyone.
* You are a (current or future) user of IRMA and would like the
  foundation to be (financially) sufficiently stable so that it can
  continue its activities in the long run.

Friend/hero-ship of the foundation does not give any policy influence:
the foundation is and remains independent. The foundation wil, if
needed, support its friends and heros first when operational problems
arise. Financial contributions will be spent only in line with the
[goals](https://privacybydesign.foundation/about/) of the foundation.
The foundation publishes a year report containing a financial
statement.
