### Privacy by Design Foundation

The Privacy by Design foundation was set-up in 2016. It arose from the
[Digital Security](http://www.ru.nl/ds/) research group of the Radboud
University and from the Privacy and Identity Lab
[PI.lab](http://www.pilab.nl).  The foundation is an independent
non-profit spin-off.

The foundation primarily works on its [IRMA](/irma-en) system for
privacy-friendly attribute-based authentication, based on freely
available open source software. 

The foundation has two important operational roles in IRMA:

1. Development and supporting the IRMA
[software](https://credentials.github.io/).

2. Supporting infrastructure for issuing attributes.

The foundation welcomes collaboration with others to get IRMA up and
running.  Pilots are now being prepared with the help of a number of
other parties, among which:

 * The [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/), for (strong)
   authentication of student and employees and for digital signing of,
   e.g., examination grades.

 * [Surfnet](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surfconext/index.html),
   for issuing and verifying of attributes through SURFconext.

 * [Alliander](http://www.alliander.nl), for authentication and
   signing within the context of `smart' homes. In addition, the
   foundation is structurally supported by Alliander.
